## Overview
This project analyzes the daily stock price movements of Apple Inc. in order to understand its return, volatility, and risk characteristics.

## Data
The dataset contains historical daily stock data for Apple Inc., including:
- Date  
- Open price  
- High price  
- Low price  
- Close price  
- Volume  

The data was obtained from a public financial dataset (Kaggle – US stock prices).

## Methodology
To measure daily performance, **Daily Return** was calculated using the formula:

Daily Return = (Close_t − Close_{t-1}) / Close_{t-1}

This calculation was applied to all trading days using Microsoft Excel.

## Results
From the analysis, the following statistics were obtained:
- **Average Daily Return:** 0.00113 (≈ 0.113%)
- **Maximum Daily Return:** 0.332 (≈ 33.2%)
- **Minimum Daily Return:** −0.518 (≈ −51.8%)

These results show that Apple stock has a positive average return but also experiences significant short-term volatility.
## Visualization
A line chart was created to visualize daily returns over time, making it easy to identify periods of stability and high volatility.
